Explanation of the code:

The function `compute_mean` calculates the mean of a list of values. 
The mean ($\bar{x}$) of a set of values is calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values.

The formula for the mean is:

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$$

where:
- $\bar{x}$ is the mean,
- $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ is the sum of all values in the list, and
- $n$ is the number of values in the list.
